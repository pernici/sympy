        This function cancels contracted elements in a product of four
        dimensional gamma matrices, resulting in an expression equal to the given
        one, without the contracted gamma matrices.

        Parameters
        ==========

        `coeff`     the coefficient of the tensor expression.
        `tids`      TIDS object representing the gamma matrix expression to simplify.

        Notes
        =====

        If spinor indices are given, the matrices must be given in
        the order given in the product. If ``t`` is
        ``G(i0)*G(i1)`` or
        ``G(i0,s0,-s1)*G(i1,s1,-s2)*G(-i0,s2,-s3)`` or
        ``G(i0,True,-s1)*G(i1,s1,-s2)*G(-i0,s2,True)``,
        ``G.kahane_simplify(t.coeff, t._tids)`` gives
        ``-2*gamma(i1, auto_left, auto_right)``

        but if one reorders the terms as in
        ``t = G(-i0,s2,-s3)*G(i0,s0,-s1)*G(i1,s1,-s2)``
        one gets the wrong result ``4*gamma(i1, auto_left, auto_right)``

        If the result is a multiple of the identity, a number is given

        `` t = G(i0)*G(-i0)`` or
        ``t = G(i0,s0,-s1)*G(-i0,s1,-s2)``
        ``G.kahane_simplify(t.coeff, t._tids)`` gives 4

        Algorithm
        =========

        The idea behind the algorithm is to use some well-known identities,
        i.e., for contractions enclosing an even number of `\gamma` matrices

        `\gamma^\mu \gamma_{a_1} \cdots \gamma_{a_{2N}} \gamma_\mu = 2 (\gamma_{a_{2N}} \gamma_{a_1} \cdots \gamma_{a_{2N-1}} + \gamma_{a_{2N-1}} \cdots \gamma_{a_1} \gamma_{a_{2N}} )`

        for an odd number of `\gamma` matrices

        `\gamma^\mu \gamma_{a_1} \cdots \gamma_{a_{2N+1}} \gamma_\mu = -2 \gamma_{a_{2N+1}} \gamma_{a_{2N}} \cdots \gamma_{a_{1}}`

        Instead of repeatedly applying these identities to cancel out all contracted indices,
        it is possible to recognize the links that would result from such an operation,
        the problem is thus reduced to a simple rearrangement of free gamma matrices.

        Examples
        ========

        When using, always remember that the original expression coefficient
        has to be handled separately

        >>> from sympy.physics.hep.gamma_matrices import GammaMatrix as G
        >>> from sympy.tensor.tensor import tensor_indices, tensorhead, TensMul, TensAdd
        >>> i0, i1, i2 = tensor_indices('i0:3', G.Lorentz)
        >>> ta = G(i0)*G(-i0)
        >>> sa = G.kahane_simplify(ta.coeff, ta._tids)
        >>> sa
        4
        >>> tb = G(i0)*G(i1)*G(-i0)
        >>> sb = G.kahane_simplify(tb.coeff, tb._tids)
        >>> sb
        -2*gamma(i1, auto_left, auto_right)

        If there are no contractions, the same expression is returned

        >>> tc = 3*G(i0)*G(i1)
        >>> sc = G.kahane_simplify(tc.coeff, tc._tids)
        >>> sc
        3*gamma(i0, auto_left, S_0)*gamma(i1, -S_0, auto_right)
